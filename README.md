# RESTful API for Products and Orders

Following tutorial Academind

#### Plan to create:

GET, POST `/products`

GET, PATCH, DELETE `/products/id`

GET, POST `/orders`

GET, DELETE `/orders/id`

POST `/users/signup`

POST `/users/login`

DELETE `/users/id`

Add authentication so only relevant connections can access certain data
